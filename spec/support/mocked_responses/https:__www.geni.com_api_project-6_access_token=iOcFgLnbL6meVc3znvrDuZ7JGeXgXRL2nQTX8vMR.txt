{"url":"https://www.geni.com/api/project-6","description":"The profiles included in this project are of the barons, bishops and abbots who created and witnessed the Magna Carta in 1215 and served as sureties for its enforcement.\r\n\r\n==Overview==\r\n\r\nThe Magna Carta was an English charter, originally issued in the year 1215. The charter first passed into law in 1225. The 1297 version, with the long title (originally in Latin) The Great Charter of the Liberties of England, and of the Liberties of the Forest, still remains on the statute books of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe 1215 Charter required King John of England to proclaim certain liberties and accept that his will was not arbitrary, for example by explicitly accepting that no \"freeman\" (in the sense of non-serf) could be punished except through the law of the land, a right which is still in existence today.\r\n\r\nMagna Carta was the first document forced onto an English King by a group of his subjects (the barons) in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their privileges. It was preceded and directly influenced by the 1100 Charter of Liberties, when King Henry I had specified particular areas where his powers would be limited.\r\n\r\nDespite its recognised importance, by the second half of the 19th century nearly all of its clauses had been repealed in their original form. Three clauses remain part of the law of England and Wales, however, and it is generally considered part of the uncodified constitution. Lord Denning described it as \"the greatest constitutional document of all times - the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot\".[1] In a 2005 speech, Lord Woolf described it as \"first of a series of instruments that now are recognised as having a special constitutional status\" [2], the others being the Habeas Corpus Act, the Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement.\r\n\r\nThe charter was an important part of the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law in the English speaking world, although it was \"far from unique, either in content or form\".[3] In practice, Magna Carta in the medieval period did not in general limit the power of kings, but by the time of the English Civil War it had become an important symbol for those who wished to show that the King was bound by the law. It influenced the early settlers in New England[4] and inspired later constitutional documents, including the United States Constitution.\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n(adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta)\r\n\r\nMany of the illuminated manuscript images on the profiles are from a manuscript from the George John Warren Vernon manuscript collection, bound after 1837, found on http://bookbinding.com/magna-carta:\r\n\"The escutcheons of the twenty-five barons \r\nwho were appointed to enforce the observance of the\r\nMagna Charta\r\ntogether with the will of\r\nKing John\r\nand the arms of the witnesses thereto.\"\r\nSee the complete collection here: http://bookbinding.com/magna-carta/before-restoration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical Persons to be Included=\r\n\r\n==Barons (Sureties for the enforcement of Magna Carta)==\r\n \t\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-d-Aubigny-Lord-of-Belvoir/6000000009255472189 William d'Aubigny, Lord of Belvoir Castle]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Roger-Bigod-2nd-Earl-of-Norfolk/6000000002606652260 Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk and Suffolk]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Hugh-Bigod-3rd-Earl-of-Norfolk/6000000001126515902 Hugh Bigod, Heir to the Earldoms of Norfolk and Suffolk]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Henry-de-Bohun/6000000001434670985 Henry de Bohun, Earl of Hereford]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Richard-de-Clare-3rd-Earl-of-Hertford/6000000003645985053 Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Gilbert-De-Clare-4th-Earl-of-Hertford/5167204065210119923 Gilbert de Clare, heir to the earldom of Hertford]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/John-of-Clavering/6000000003827280089 John FitzRobert, Lord of Warkworth Castle]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Robert-de-Clare/6000000003827151457 Robert FitzWalter de Clare, Lord of Dunmow Castle]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-de-Forz/6000000000424798772 William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle]\r\n\r\nWilliam Hardel, **Mayor of the City of London\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-de-Huntingfield/368756446860013200 William de Huntingfield, Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/John-de-Lacy-1st-Earl-of-Lincoln/6000000000166150229 John de Lacy, Lord of Pontefract Castle]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-de-Lanvallei/6000000003827232851 William de Lanvallei, Lord of Standway Castle]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-Malet/6000000003693601810 William Malet, Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset] \r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Geoffrey-de-Mandeville/6000000010020022175 Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex and Gloucester]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-Marshal-2nd-Earl-of-Pembroke/6000000000424886987 William Marshall Jr, heir to the earldom of Pembroke]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Roger-de-Montbegon/6000000010181023229 Roger de Montbegon, Lord of Hornby Castle, Lancashire] \r\n\t\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Richard-de-Montfichet/6000000000424798876 Richard de Montfichet, Baron of Stanstead]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/William-de-Mowbray/6000000000796884769 William de Mowbray, Lord of Axholme Castle] \r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Richard-de-Percy/6000000000969942000 Richard de Percy, Baron]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Saher-IV-de-Quincy-1st-Earl-of-Winchester/6000000003146930404 Saire/Saher de Quincy, Earl of Winchester] \r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Robert-De-Ros/6000000000437148369 Robert de Ros, Lord of Hamlake Castle] \r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Geoffrey-II-Magna-Carta-Surety-de-Say/6000000001354634669 Geoffrey de Saye, Baron]\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Robert-de-Vere/6000000001210373280 Robert de Vere, heir to the earldom of Oxford] \r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Eustace-de-Vesci/6000000001300434501 Eustace de Vesci, Lord of Alnwick Castle]\r\n\r\n\r\n==Bishops: Witnesses==\r\n\r\nStephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church\r\n\r\nHenry de Loundres, Archbishop of Dublin\r\n\r\nE., Bishop of London\r\n\r\nJocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath and Wells\r\n\r\nPeter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester\r\n\r\nHugh de Wells, Bishop of Lincoln\r\n\r\nHerbert Poore (aka \"Robert\"), Bishop of Salisbury\r\n\r\nW., Bishop of Rochester\r\n\r\nWalter de Gray, Bishop of Worcester\r\n\r\nGeoffrey de Burgo, Bishop of Ely\r\n\r\nHugh de Mapenor, Bishop of Hereford\r\n\r\nRichard Poore, Bishop of Chichester (brother of Herbert/Robert above)\r\n\r\nW., Bishop of Exeter\r\n\r\n==Others==\r\n\r\n[http://www.geni.com/people/Llewelyn-ap-Iorwerth/6000000003807598493 Llywelyn the Great].
